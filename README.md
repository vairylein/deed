# Data Ethics Emergency Drill Toolbox

![logo](./assets/img/DEED_logo.svg)]


## About

The data ethics emergency drill (DEED) is similar to a fire drill, where a data and AI team plays out a scenario of some fictional issue with their data science/ML/AI system that has ethical implications. A data ethics emergency could be, for example, a hiring algorithm that has only been tested on young people and once it was deployed, discriminated against old people. The DEEDâ€™s main goal is to help technologists reflect on the ethics of their applications in a safe space and practice having conversations around ethical concerns.
