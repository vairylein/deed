After trying and testing the DEED method with several data science teams, we have created a suggested structure for facilitators to plan running a drill. The prep sheet includes tips and advice on each phase:

- Phase 1: Finding participants, finding an occasion
- Phase 2: Scenario crafting with the template
- Phase 3: Preparing the drill, creating the prompts, setting the scene
- Phase 4: Running the drill, briefing participants, presenting prompts
- Phase 5: Reflecting on the session, turning them into findings and communicating findings
